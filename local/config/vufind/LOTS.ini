; To enable password recovery this needs to be enabled.
; The function is using koha's functions and are therefore
; not totaly internal.
; When the user gets an email with a link to create a new
; password they are linked to the koha-opac, not to Vufind/LOTS.
; It is therefore not certain they will find their way back
; to LOTS after creating the password.
; To have them come back here you will have to make some change
; in the koha-opac templates, css or JavaScript.
